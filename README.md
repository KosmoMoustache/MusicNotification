# Customization
You can customize the music name, author and soundtrack by creating a file called `musics.json` under `./assets/musicnotification/musics.json` of your ressource pack.

See [musics.json](https://github.com/KosmoMoustache/MusicNotification/blob/main/src/main/resources/assets/musicnotification/musics.json) for the default file.
